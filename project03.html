          <h2>Floating Static Routing</h2>
          <p>
            Floating Static Routing is a static routing function that automatically configures the backup path in the
            routing table when the target network path is set to static, but if the configured path goes down.<br>
            Static routing has a disadvantage that if the route to the destination network is down, the administrator
            must detect the change in topology and manually set another route. This is secured by Floating Static
            Routing.

          <h2>Path will be changed automatically</h2>
          <p>When going from S1 to S2, the path is S1->R1->R2->R4->S2.<br>
            At this time, when the R1<->R2 path is down, the path is changed to S1->R1->R3->R4->S2 by floating static.
              Note that if you turn down fa 0/0 of R1, the route to which you are going is changed, but the route to
              return is not changed, so routing is not possible. The timeout needs to be set in the sla echo packet to
              recognize network changes.

          <h2>PBR(Policy Based Routing) with IP SLA(Internet protocol service level agreement)</h2>
          <p>
            Cisco IOS IP SLAs continuously collect data about such things as response times, latency, jitter and packet
            loss. This not only provides the network administrator with baseline information about network performance,
            it also helps the administrator to verify Quality of Service (QoS) levels and quickly identify the root of a
            problem if performance levels drop. When integrated with a network management system (NMS), visual alerts of
            threshold violations can be captured in real-time. IP SLAs are especially useful for wide area networks
            (WANs) that connect multiple geographies and needs to be monitored from one central location.

          <h2>Path adjust</h2>
          <p>
            Because the routing protocol is rip, load is distributed. This is done by adding a hop count (rip metric) to
            the route of S2-R3-R1-S1 and changing the optimal route to S1-R2-R3-S2. (In normal circumstances, I want it
            to be routed down the path) And without adjusting this rip policy, when S1_lo0(1.11.11.1) goes to
            S2_lo0(1.22.22.1) I make the path I want. (The route I want is S2-R3-R1-S1) <br>
            That is, the optimal path of rip is S2-R3-R2-S1 / The path I want is S2-R3-R1-S1 <-- Adjust with PBR </p>

          <h2>RIP(Routing Information Protocol)</h2>
          <p>
            The routing information protocol is a routing protocol operating on UDP/IP.
            RIP is a task of dynamically exchanging routes with neighboring hosts using an algorithm called DVA by
            quantifying the number of routers that may be routed through the number of hops. Determines the shortest
            path for a packet to reach its destination network address.

          <p>
            It is the distance vector internal gateway protocol (IGP) invented by Cisco. It is used by routers for the
            purpose of exchanging routing data in autonomous systems. <br>
            IGRP was created to partially overcome the limitations of RIP (maximum number of hops 15, one routing
            metric) when used in large networks. IGRP supports multiple metrics for individual paths, including
            bandwidth, delay, load, MTU, and reliability.

          <h2>IGRP is considered a classed routing protocol</h2>
          <p>
            Since this protocol has no space for a subnet mask, the router assumes that all subnetwork addresses in the
            same Class A, Class B, and Class C network have the same subnet mask as the one configured on the interface.
            This contrasts with classless routing protocols that can use a variable subnet mask (VLSM).

          <h2>OSPF(Open Shortest Path First)</h2>
          <p>
            OSPF is a routing protocol for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), operating within a single autonomous system (AS).<br>
            All OSPF areas must be physically or virtually linked to the backbone area (= area0). Because ospf is a link state, it knows its own area information accurately, but for other areas, the ABR router should put summary information. Therefore, the ABR router must be connected to the backbone area.

            Currently, the state of area0 network is performing multicast update and is in full mesh state. I am trying to make the area0 section a hub&spoke structure. In the hub & spoke structure, the DR must be performed by the hub, and the spokes must never do DR/BDR.<br>
            When ospf advertises loopback, which is a virtual interface, ospf knows that loopback is not a network because it is a link state. So it advertises as a host. (= 32bit ad)<br>
            If you want to advertise in the original bit (16bit), set loopback directly in ospf, or redistribute by specifying the target through the access-list.
