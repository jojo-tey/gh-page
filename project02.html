          <h2>Advantage of NAT(Network Address Translation)</h2>
          <p>
            NAT is a system that converts one public IP to several private IPs. A router with two or more LAN cards acts
            as an intermediary between the private network and the external network. The router used a lot in the
            vicinity is a typical NAT system. In addition, the private network is structured so that access from the
            external network to the internal PC of the private network is impossible unless special settings are made,
            so the security is strong.

          <h2>Theory of NAT</h2>
          <p>When the first sender delivers the packet to the gateway, SRC_IP is filled with the sender's address inside
            the private network. For communication, the gateway receives the packet and randomly modifies the IP address
            in the packet to its public IP and sends it to the destination. The recipient who receives the packet will
            send the packet with the public IP inserted by the gateway in the destination IP address, and the packet
            will reach the gateway.

          <h2>VLAN(Virtual Local Area Network)</h2>
          <p>
            As a function supported by a switch, it is to create multiple networks in one switch. Multiple networks
            means that broadcast domains are divided. When networks are divided in this way, communication between each
            other becomes possible only through routers.

          <h2>This is similar concept as NAT</h2>
          <p>
            Broadcast domains of hosts connected to the same switch can be virtually divided, or broadcast domains of
            hosts connected to different switches can be combined. Like NAT, when internal vlans go out, the switch
            converts the vlan into one public address and transmits it. By default, the unused vlan number is put in the
            distribution switch so that other vlans other than the licensed vlan cannot enter.

          <h2>Trunking</h2>
          <p>
            Originally, one link per VLAN should be allocated, but since too many links are required in that case,
            trunking is used so that all VLANs can move through one link. At this time, tag each vlan so that it can be
            properly distributed at the destination.

            with the router. IP communication is performed between the router and the L3 Switch. You cannot use Trunk or
            Allow. SVI allows communication between VLANs using the router's Routing Protocol. It's a technology that
            makes it possible.

GLBP provides load balancing for multiple routers using a single virtual IP address and multiple MAC addresses.

        Members of the GLBP group elect AVG and standby virtual gateway (SVG). If there are more than 3 members, the remaining members are in the listening state. When AVG goes down, SVG takes over. Then, among the members in the listening state, SVG is again elected. Even if AVG comes back to life or a new member with high priority appears, AVG and SVG will not change unless preempt is used. AVG allocates virtual mac addresses to each member of the GLBP group. HSRP has one virtual mac in a virtual ip, but GLBP assigns one virtual mac address to each member. However, up to 4 virtual macs can be allocated per group in GLBP.

So assign client and server to different vlans, configure dhcp relay agent, change to unicast in the middle, and deliver to server<br>
        <b>agent : </b> L3 function(command: ip helper address), still normal dhcp cannot be controlled(Weak against dhcp starvation attack) -> [Solution 1-port security, 2-user authentication (ieee802.1x-dot1x)]<br>
        <b>offer : </b>server's response to discovery (if there are multiple servers) -> dhcp snooping is used to distinguish unauthorized servers (all ports become untrusted-messages from servers coming from all ports are blocked) -> Build in agent -> Directly declare the port where the server message should come in.<br>
        <b>request : </b> [1. Client's response to offer / 2. Request message]<br>
        <b>ack : </b>Server's response to request

      <h2>Rental period renewal</h2>
      <p>
        When the first renewal is attempted, the renewal is attempted when 50% of the rental period remains. The client directly transmits in the form of a DHCPQUEST message.
        If the server transmits affirmative ACK, it transmits the updated parameters along with the new IP.
        When the server is turned off or cannot be received, the client receives a message indicating that it has not been updated.
        However, since 50% of the rental period is still remaining, the use of TCP/IP is maintained.
        When 87.5% of the rental period expires, the second renewal is attempted.
        If the second renewal fails, the lease period expires or when DHCPNACK is received, the DHCP Client stops using the IP address and has to go through the above 4 steps again to request an IP again.
